We opted for the example http://bl.ocks.org/GerHobbelt/3071239 beacuse graphically had what we were looking for but only after diving in the code we realized how many were the changes and improvements in order to satisfy all our requirements. In particular, the code was not versatile and quite messy. We needed a structure that would allow to easily update the graph (ecxlude/include nodes) and also easy to maintain (so to apport changes easily). Therefore, we restructured most of the code implementing classes (which improved versatility and manageability), removing a couple of features we did not need and improving the efficiency (e.g. the graph was initially recomputed every time a node was collapsed/expanded, now we exclude/include easier and faster only the interested nodes). We decided to use classes to draw both the catecory and the product graph so that we could easily keep their state and update their view.
